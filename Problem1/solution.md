# Approach 1: Brute Force - Merging Arrays of Objects by ID

## Description

In this approach, we aim to merge two arrays of objects (`arr1` and `arr2`) based on their `ID`. The goal is to combine the contents of both arrays while ensuring that objects with the same `ID` are merged together. The properties from the second array (`arr2`) take precedence over those in the first array (`arr1`).

### Steps

1. **Combine the arrays**: We start by creating a new array called `combinedArray` by merging `arr1` and `arr2`. This ensures that all the objects from both arrays are included in a single array.
2. **Initialize the merged object**: We create an empty object called `merged`. This object will store the merged objects, using their `ID` as the key.

3. **Iterate over the combined array**: We loop through each object in the `combinedArray` using the `forEach` method.

   - For each object, we check if its `ID` already exists as a key in the `merged` object.
   - If the `ID` doesn't exist, we add a new entry to `merged` with the `ID` as the key, and the current object as the value (using the spread operator to create a copy of the object).
   - If the `ID` already exists, we merge the current object with the existing object in `merged`, ensuring that properties from `arr2` override those from `arr1`.

4. **Extract the merged objects**: After processing all objects, we extract the values from the `merged` object using `Object.values()`. This gives us an array, `joinedArray`, containing only the merged objects, without the `ID` keys.

5. **Return the result**: The final result is an array of merged objects.

# Complexity Analysis:

## Time complexity:

The time complexity is O(nlogn) due to the sort function, where n is the total number of elements in the combined array (length of arr1 plus length of arr2). The iteration and merging process also contributes to the time complexity, but it is dominated by the sorting operation.

## Space complexity:

The space complexity is O(n), where n is again the total number of elements in the combined array. This is because a new array (combinedArray) and a new object (merged) are created, each of which can potentially store all the elements from arr1 and arr2.
